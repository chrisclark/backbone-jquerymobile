# Backbone.js + jQuery Mobile #

This is a slight update to the approach created by Christophe Coenraets here]( http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/03/using-backbone-js-with-jquery-mobile). Much thanks to Christophe for coming up with this simple method to make these frameworks play nicely together!

I've replaced some deprecated jQuery calls with something that will work with the latest version, added support for dialogs, and tweaked some things to make the app friendlier for use with PhoneGap.
